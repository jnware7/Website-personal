# Portfolio-Site
Create a Portfolio Site
## Description

Create a good lookin’ portfolio / resume site to help you get a job! Highlight your most impressive projects. To complete this goal, you’ll need to have links to at least 2 live projects so part of your week might be spent cleaning up old projects and putting them on the internet.

## Specifications
